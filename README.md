- 👋 Hi, I’m @TashaNaps42
- 👀 I’m interested in learning. I have utilized github in a group project - making and approving pull requests, making complex and often incompatible commits into a functional merge, and communicating with a team to pick the best course for updating our main branch. I am comfortable with JavaScript and C#. I have used Angular, React, and many dependencies for .net, particularly a suite related to MVC projects. I know the basics of SQL, but plan to practice more. I have a huge amount to learn, but luckily I enjoy problem solving. 
- 🌱 I’m currently looking into Azure and just generally learning about web services and site hosting. I am also honing skills in SQL, and improving my C# when I work on my passion project, which is a private repo.
- 💞️ After doing a little learning with Azure (and perhaps other ways of hosting sites) in a theoretical way, I am interested in either publishing a basic website of my own, or getting onto an open source project. If I knew rust I'd be volunteering to work on the SCP Wiki's port to a new website, so maybe I'll look into Rust.
- 📫 How to reach me: My LinkedIn can be found [here](https://www.linkedin.com/in/natasha-lewis-37738b261/) and my professional email is natasha.lewis.lalor@gmail.com. If you wish to send me spam, feel free to send that to natashiolio@gmail.com.
