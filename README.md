- 👋 Hi, I’m @TashaNaps42
- 👀 I’m interested in learning, I know nothing.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning to use VCS's, subtly learning HTML and JS, eventually C#. I am in class, but I am a baby programmer.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on whatever my class tells me to.
- 📫 How to reach me: wait about half a year for me to know what I'm doing, then we'll chat.
