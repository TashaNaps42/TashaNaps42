- 👋 Hi, I’m @TashaNaps42
- 👀 I’m interested in learning. I know how to use GitHub, am comfortable with JS, C#. I have used Angular, React, and many dependencies for .net, particularly a suite related to MVC projects. I have a huge amount to learn, I mean programming is attractive because it seems like there's an infinite amount to learn. I am just beginning and excited.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning to build a project from scratch (well I mean the framework got us pretty far, maybe not from scratch) with a group - going from having to cautiously merge branches to it becoming second nature to branch and then merge.
- 💞️ I’m looking, albeit not very hard while I look into starting a job, for fun C# open source projects to learn by working on. I'd want a group that doesn't mind a bunch of questions, and I'd be cool with taking the uninteresting work from more seasoned programmers.
- 📫 How to reach me: (LinkedIn will be made) - my email for actual projects, jobs, etc. would be natasha.lewis.lalor@gmail.com. If you wish to send me spam, feel free to send that to natashiolio@gmail.com.
